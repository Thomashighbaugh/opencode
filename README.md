# OpenCode Hubs

> Hub-Driven Multi-Agent Orchestration for OpenCode — Interactive Menus, Not Memorization.

The name derives from the hub-and-spoke orchestration concept — a central operations hub that coordinates specialized units rather than trying to do everything itself. Each hub dispatches to a curated roster of 29 agents, 76 skills, 14 tools, and 2 commands through structured menus instead of requiring you to remember every capability's exact name.

The codebase is continuously optimized — `getProjectRoot()` is cached to avoid redundant git forks, state directory scans are depth-limited to O(1), and the plugin system is split into focused modules (session, modes, keywords, hooks) for maintainability. Model tiering (top/mid/fast) provides intelligent routing across deepseek-v4-pro, deepseek-v4-flash, nemotron-3-ultra, and glm-5.1.

## Quick Reference: Hub Menus

| Hub | Subcommands | Purpose |
|-----|-------------|---------|
| `/init-project` | 10 | Project initialization, detection, validation, and diagnostics |
| `/ideation` | 26 | Planning, research, and structured thinking — 24 methodologies |
| `/orchestrate` | 32 | Execution patterns — from persistent loops to multi-stage pipelines |
| `/harvest-context` | 18 | Knowledge extraction and artifact management |
| `/project` | 20 | Git operations, code quality, release management, file organization |

No arguments on any hub produces an interactive menu. Supply a subcommand directly to skip the menu: `/orchestrate ralph`, `/project commit`, `/harvest-context session`.

## Overview

OpenCode Hubs solves a problem of scale. A configuration that accumulates 29 agents, 64 skills, and 6 commands over time becomes a burden of memory rather than a toolbox. The natural response — "I hope what I need exists somewhere" — is not a workflow.

The five hubs (`/init-project`, `/ideation`, `/orchestrate`, `/harvest-context`, `/project`) give every capability a discoverable home, ordered by the project development lifecycle. Each hub offers a menu when invoked without arguments, listing subcommands with descriptions. For experienced users, direct invocation skips the menu entirely: `/orchestrate ralph fix all TypeScript errors`.

### Architecture

Every hub follows the same three-phase lifecycle:

1. **Argument Detection** — No arguments produce an interactive menu; a recognized subcommand proceeds directly.
2. **Execution** — A terse reminder confirms intent, the hub checks for prior state, then delegates to the appropriate skill or agent.
3. **Post-Completion** — The hub suggests the next logical step in the workflow chain: init sets the stage, ideation leads to orchestration, orchestration leads to context harvesting, and completed artifacts should be committed.

Three hubs (`ideation`, `orchestrate`, `harvest-context`) persist progress to `.opencode/state/` for session-to-session continuity. The `/project` hub is intentionally stateless — git serves as its record.

### Execution Modes

| Mode | Trigger | Purpose |
|------|---------|---------|
| **Hubs** | `"hubs"` | Orchestrate subagents for complex multi-step tasks with auto-context creation |
| **Autopilot** | `"autopilot"` or `/orchestrate autopilot` | Full autonomous execution from idea to working code |
| **Ultrawork** | `"ulw"` or `/orchestrate ultrawork` | Maximum parallel execution for high-throughput tasks |
| **Team** | `/orchestrate team` | N coordinated agents on shared task lists |
| **UltraQA** | `/ultraqa` | QA cycling — test, verify, fix — until all criteria are met |

### Magic Keywords

Natural language triggers that invoke subcommands directly, bypassing the menu. Useful when you know what you want; potentially surprising when you type "don't stop" in casual conversation.

| Keyword | Routes To |
|---------|-----------|
| `"ralph"`, `"don't stop"` | `/orchestrate ralph` |
| `"autopilot"`, `"build me"` | `/orchestrate autopilot` |
| `"ultrawork"`, `"ulw"` | `/orchestrate ultrawork` |
| `"deep interview"` | `/ideation deep` |
| `"plan"` | `/ideation plan` |
| `"cancel"`, `"stop"` | Cancel any active mode |

## State Vs Context

| Type | Location | Git | Purpose |
|------|----------|-----|---------|
| **State** | `.opencode/state/` | Ignored | Ephemeral session data — progress, checkpoints, active modes, secrets |
| **Context** | `.opencode/context/` | Committed | Durable knowledge — frameworks, patterns, research, ADRs, theory |

The separation is deliberate. State is transient and compaction-safe. Context accumulates across sessions and forms a persistent project memory.
